# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. Each year, new programming puzzles are released daily from December 1st to December 25th, and this repository is where I document my journey and solutions. 🎅✨

## Repository Structure

The solutions for each year are organized into folders. For example:

```
.
├── 2024
│   ├── day-01
│   │   ├── input.txt
│   │   ├── instructions.txt
│   │   ├── part01.py
│   │   └── part02.py
│   ├── day-02
│   │   ├── input.txt
│   │   ├── instructions.txt
│   │   ├── part01.py
│   │   └── part02.py
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

- **`2024/`**: Contains solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code.
  - **`day-XX/`**: Each day has its own folder.
    - `input.txt`: The puzzle input for that day. 📝
    - `instructions.txt`: Additional instructions or notes about the puzzle. 📖
    - `part01.py`: Solution for Part 1 of the day's puzzle. 🧩
    - `part02.py`: Solution for Part 2 of the day's puzzle. 🎯
